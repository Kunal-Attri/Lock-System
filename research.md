LBPH Research
Parameters
* Radius - set to 1
* Neighbours - set to 8
* Grid X - set to 8 
* Grid Y - set to 8

Each pixel(of the gray scaled image) converted into a 3x3 matrix. (0 - 255). 
Central value used as threshold
FOr neighbours for equal or higher central value(threshold) it is set to 1 otherwise 0 
then this binary values are turnt back into decimal which then becomes back to a pixel in the image
then we will prolly get the boundary of the image ( circular LBP)
* bilinear interpolation - > to research
Grid X and Grid Y will help to divide the image into multiple grids.

okay this shit got outta hand from here
